#live-html5

HTML5 Starter Template with **Live Page Reloading** during authoring, both on Desktop and Mobile Devices.

For more information visit: **[matthiasn.github.io/live-html5](http://matthiasn.github.io/live-html5)**

##Installation:

Download or clone project, then install dependencies by running 

    npm install
   
followed by

    bower install
    
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the authoring environment by simply running server.js in the directory you want the client to watch. The typical case would be to run it inside the src folder:

    ../scripts/server.js

Note that you will need to make server.js executable for this to work:

    chmod +x server.js
    
A distribution-ready, minified and compressed version of the website can be created using

    grunt dist

##Contributions
